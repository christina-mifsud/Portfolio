      <p>
        Our team embarked on a comprehensive initiative to revamp an existing
        hotel management system, integrating modern component-based architecture
        to enhance usability, functionality, and maintainability. By leveraging
        React.js and other contemporary web technologies, we aimed to create a
        more intuitive and efficient platform for hotel staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Component Modularization</span><br />
        We focused on modularizing various components of the system to improve
        code organization and maintainability. This involved extracting key
        elements such as the search button and header into separate components,
        facilitating easier management and future updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Visual Enhancement</span><br />
        The project focused on improving the visual appeal and user experience
        of the hotel management system. We introduced visually appealing info
        cards showcasing tourist information for prominent cities, refining the
        user interface and providing valuable destination insights.

        <img src="img/ " alt=" " />
      </div>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Data Integration</span> <br />Seamless
        integration with external data sources was a critical aspect of the
        project. We successfully implemented functionality to fetch data from an
        external API, allowing real-time updates and synchronization with the
        hotel management system.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">State Management</span> <br />Utilizing
        React's state management capabilities, we ensured that the system could
        react dynamically to user interactions. Components were designed to
        maintain state, allowing for seamless updates and rendering based on
        user input.
      </p>

      <div class="project-details-img-container">

        <img src="img/ " alt=" " />
      </div>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Functionality Expansion</span> <br />Our
        efforts extended beyond aesthetic enhancements to encompass the
        expansion of system functionalities. We introduced features such as
        calculating the duration of guests' stays and displaying it within the
        booking table, enhancing the system's utility and providing valuable
        insights to hotel staff.
      </p>

      <p>Tech Stack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frontend: React, Bootstrap</li>
        <li>Backend: Node.js, Express.js</li>
        <li>Database: PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>Deployment: Netlify</li>
        <li>Additional Libraries: Moment.js</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By adopting a component-based architecture and modern web technologies,
        we significantly improved the usability, functionality, and
        maintainability of the hotel management system. The revamped system
        provides a more intuitive user interface, streamlined administrative
        workflows, and enhanced guest experiences.
