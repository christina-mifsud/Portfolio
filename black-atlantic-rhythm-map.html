        Our team has collaborated closely with artist and dance researcher
        <a
          href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/fmt/doctoralschool/phdcandidates/#deirdre-molloy"
          >Deirdre Molloy</a
        >
        to develop an immersive multimedia platform known as the "Black Atlantic
        Rhythm Map", an integral part of her exploration into the African
        Atlantic Diaspora narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        This innovative map serves as a dynamic representation of shared
        experiences and movements that have shaped the identity of the Black
        Atlantic community. It emphasizes the significance of drum-dance
        dialogues, presented in circular formations, as enduring traditions
        fostering resilience, emotional evolution, and cultural innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Black Atlantic Rhythm Map" visually encapsulates the transmission
        of rhythmic knowledge along historical slave routes, integrating layers
        of temporal and spatial dimensions, from past migrations to contemporary
        expressions. It amalgamates diverse content types, including digital and
        archival mapping, typographic narratives, textual resources, video
        footage, and audio recordings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our primary aim was to develop a website showcasing the following key
        features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Interactive Map</span>: A central
          component of the website is an interactive map illustrating the
          dissemination of rhythmic knowledge across the Black Atlantic. Users
          can engage with the map by clicking on markers representing various
          rhythms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Clickable Markers</span>: Each marker
          on the map is clickable, enabling users to access a comprehensive list
          of rhythms associated with specific rhythm codes. These codes denote
          the origins of distinct rhythmic traditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Modal Display</span>: Clicking on a
          rhythm marker or selecting a rhythm from the list triggers a modal
          display containing multimedia content. This content comprises videos,
          audio clips, and textual descriptions, offering users in-depth
          insights into each rhythm's cultural significance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Responsive Design</span>: While the
          website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience
          across different devices, achieving full responsiveness for the map
          section proved challenging within the project's timeframe due to
          complexities associated with making large SVG files adapt seamlessly
          to smaller screens.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="project-details-img-container">
        <div class="gradient-overlay"></div>
        <img src="img/rhythm-map-modal.png" alt="rhythm map modal screenshot" />
      </div>

      <p>
        To realize these features, we utilized
        <span style="font-weight: 600">React</span> for frontend development,
        <span style="font-weight: 600">Express</span> for backend functionality,
        and a <span style="font-weight: 600">PostgreSQL</span> database to
        manage and store relevant data. The website is hosted on Render,
        ensuring widespread accessibility from any location with internet
        connectivity.
      </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Live Implementation:</span> The production version, implemented by <a href ="https://gerador.eu/">Gerador</a>, an independent platform for journalism, culture and education, is now live and accessible to the public at <a href="https://unityatlantic.org/">unityatlantic.org/</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The "Black Atlantic Rhythm Map" serves as a pivotal element in Deirdre
        Molloy's narrative, intended for public exhibition to enrich
        understanding and appreciation of the African Atlantic Diaspora's
        cultural legacy.
