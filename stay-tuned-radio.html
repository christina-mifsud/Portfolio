      <p>
        Our team recognized the communal desire to share and discover music,
        especially while engaging in focused activities like coding. However,
        the absence of a dedicated platform to curate and stream
        community-sourced music inspired us to develop a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Introducing our app, a music-sharing platform integrated with Spotify,
        designed to foster community engagement and discovery. Each day, a
        selection of songs from our extensive database is randomly curated and
        added to a Spotify playlist, accessible via a widget embedded within our
        app. Users can return daily to explore fresh tracks recommended by
        fellow community members.
      </p>
      <p>
        While our app is publicly available, exclusive access to certain
        features, such as song submissions, is reserved for community members.
        Authentication is seamlessly facilitated through Slack, leveraging the
        Sign in with Slack feature. Team members are authenticated based on
        their membership within the designated Slack workspace. Upon
        authentication, users gain access to the song submission feature, where
        they can contribute to expanding our music database by providing song
        details and URL.
      </p>

      <div class="project-details-img-container">
        <div class="gradient-overlay"></div>
        <img
          src="img/stay-tuned-radio-add-song.png"
          alt=" add song functionality screenshot"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Technologically, our app is built using
        <span style="font-weight: 600">Vite React</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: 600">Bootstrap</span> for frontend
        development, while <span style="font-weight: 600">Node.js</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: 600">Express.js</span> power the backend. Data
        management is handled through
        <span style="font-weight: 600">PostgreSQL</span>, ensuring robust and
        efficient storage of song information. Deployment is streamlined with
        Render, facilitating seamless accessibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, our integration with external APIs enriches user experience
        and functionality. The
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: var(--brand)">Slack API</span>
        enables secure authentication, verifying users' team membership before
        granting access to additional features. Meanwhile, the
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: var(--brand)">Spotify API</span>
        facilitates seamless integration, allowing our app to dynamically
        generate and update playlists based on community submissions. <br />
        Security is paramount in our design. We employ
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: var(--brand)"
          >JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</span
        >
        to facilitate secure transmission of user data between frontend and
        backend components. Following industry best practices, JWTs are issued
        upon user authentication, enabling subsequent requests without exposing
        sensitive tokens.
      </p>

          alt=" sign in with slack authentication screenshot"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Our app not only serves as a platform for music sharing but also fosters
        a sense of community and collaboration among users. By leveraging modern
        technologies and seamless integrations, we aim to enhance the
        music-sharing experience and cultivate a vibrant community hub for music
        enthusiasts.
