      <p>
        The Quiz App project is an interactive platform currently under
        development, aimed at providing users with an engaging quiz experience.
        Leveraging technologies such as
        <span style="font-weight: 700">TypeScript, Next.js, Firebase</span> for
        authentication, and <span style="font-weight: 700">Firestore</span> for
        data storage, the app facilitates dynamic rendering of quiz categories
        and questions, enabling users to test their knowledge on various topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leveraging Next.js, the platform incorporates server-side rendering and
        dynamic route generation, ensuring efficient performance and smooth
        navigation. Dynamic rendering capabilities enable the retrieval of quiz
        questions and answers from Firestore, providing users with diverse and
        engaging content. The application facilitates answer selection and
        validation, offering real-time feedback on correctness, along with score
        calculation and tracking of correct and incorrect responses. Seamless
        navigation between quiz questions enhances user experience, culminating
        in the display of results upon quiz completion. Integration of Firebase
        for user authentication enables personalized quiz experiences, while the
        utilization of Firestore ensures efficient storage and retrieval of quiz
        data, ensuring scalability and optimal performance for users.
